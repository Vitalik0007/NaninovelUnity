# 📖 NaninovelUnity – Visual Novel System Test Project

🎯 **Purpose**

🧪 **What’s Inside**
- Basic setup and configuration of the Naninovel engine
- Custom script examples for branching dialogue and scene transitions
- Integration of simple UI elements and scene management
- Experimentation with text, character sprites, and background switching

💡 **Goal**  
The main goal was to become familiar with how Naninovel works and how it can be extended or customized for future visual novel projects.

📁 **Included**
- Unity C# scripts related to custom logic
- Sample Naninovel scripts used for testing features
- Basic scene setup
